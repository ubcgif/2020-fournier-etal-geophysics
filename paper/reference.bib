  abstract = { The gravity method was the first geophysical technique to be used in oil and gas exploration. Despite being eclipsed by seismology, it has continued to be an important and sometimes crucial constraint in a number of exploration areas. In oil exploration the gravity method is particularly applicable in salt provinces, overthrust and foothills belts, underexplored basins, and targets of interest that underlie high-velocity zones. The gravity method is used frequently in mining applications to map subsurface geology and to directly calculate ore reserves for some massive sulfide orebodies. There is also a modest increase in the use of gravity techniques in specialized investigations for shallow targets. Gravimeters have undergone continuous improvement during the past 25 years, particularly in their ability to function in a dynamic environment. This and the advent of global positioning systems (GPS) have led to a marked improvement in the quality of marine gravity and have transformed airborne gravity from a regional technique to a prospect-level exploration tool that is particularly applicable in remote areas or transition zones that are otherwise inaccessible. Recently, moving-platform gravity gradiometers have become available and promise to play an important role in future exploration. Data reduction, filtering, and visualization, together with low-cost, powerful personal computers and color graphics, have transformed the interpretation of gravity data. The state of the art is illustrated with three case histories: 3D modeling of gravity data to map aquifers in the Albuquerque Basin, the use of marine gravity gradiometry combined with 3D seismic data to map salt keels in the Gulf of Mexico, and the use of airborne gravity gradiometry in exploration for kimberlites in Canada. },

  abstract  = { Two new techniques are employed in analysis of aeromagnetic data from the San Juan basin, New Mexico, to enhance the expression of buried basement structure and lithology: (1) the data are analytically continued downward onto the irregular basement surface in order to reduce the effect of variable depth to basement, and (2) magnetization boundaries are delineated by a linear filter based on the gradient of pseudogravity. Reduction to the basement involves three procedures that, together, provide a practical method for continuation of potential fields between general surfaces. Data are continued from the nonlevel flight-elevation surface onto a level surface (drape-to- level continuation) by means of a system of successive approximations based on expansion of a Taylor series. Data are continued from the new level surface downward to another level surface at the mean elevation of the basement (level-to-level continuation) by analytical downward continuation based on the fast Fourier transform, incorporating a high-cut filter. Data are continued from this level onto the nonlevel basement surface (level-to-drape continuation) by direct evaluation of a truncated Taylor series expansion, in the vertical dimension, of the field represented on the level surface. Magnetization boundaries are determined by evaluating the magnitude of the horizontal gradient of the pseudogravity transform of the magnetic data. Lines drawn along ridges of the horizontal gradient mark inferred basement-magnetization boundaries. After application of these techniques, the aeromagnetic data from the San Juan basin, New Mexico, revealed features of the Precambrian basement not evident, or only vaguely so, in the original data. Together with scanty drill data, the aeromagnetic data indicate a 70-km-wide belt of predominantly metasupracrustal rocks trending east-northeast across the center of the basin. Predominantly granitic terranes border this belt on the northwest and southeast. Numerous magnetization boundaries tens of kilometers in length are identified. Structural grain is strongly east-northeast; an area of prominent northerly trends occurs in the north-central part of the basin and locally elsewhere. Cenozoic intrusive rocks are unquestionably aligned with basement structural grain. Laramide and Neogene structures in general are not so aligned. There is no evidence of large strike-slip displacement of basement structures within the area surveyed. },

The dip is always related to the local phase angle of a complex analytic signal evaluated directly over the source. For magnetic sheets, the complex analytic signal is constructed from the anomaly and its Hilbert transform. For magnetic contacts or density sheets, it is constructed from the first‐order horizontal and vertical derivatives of the anomaly. Dip estimation is implemented as an integral part of source‐location algorithms. The analytic signal and local wavenumber methods require interpolation of the local phase from sampled anomaly or derivative values.

  abstract = { A self‐adjusting curve‐matching computer program for the interpretation of magnetic anomalies produced by dike‐like bodies is described. The method yields an optimum set of dike parameter values by selecting a best‐fit model anomaly curve for a given set of discrete observed data along a profile across a two‐dimensional anomaly. The criterion used by the computer for the selection of a best‐fit curve may be either the linear or least squares condition. Convergence to either of these conditions requires the solution of a nonlinear problem. In the present case, solution is achieved by automatic trial and error modifications of an initial model. Selection of the initial model is based upon the shape of the observed anomaly; the proper choice of an initial model assures convergence of the error of fit to an absolute rather than to a relative minimum. The repeatability of the convergence of the iterative process can be tested by changing the initial model within the allowable ranges of variation of the dike parameters. Interpretations of finite strike length anomalies are achieved through the use of a correction curve. With this method, best‐depth estimates to the top of dike‐like bodies may be determined and for cases of induced magnetization, the effective susceptibility contrast and the dip of the dike may be calculated. Two practical applications of the method are presented. },

Geologic constraints are imposed by use of a structural index. Model studies show that the method can locate or outline confined sources, vertical pipes, dikes, and contacts with remarkable accuracy. A field example using data from an intensively studied area of onshore Britain shows that the method works well on real data from structurally complex areas and provides a series of depth‐labeled Euler trends which mark magnetic edges, notably faults, with good precision. },

The estimate of the depth is independent of the magnetic inclination, declination, dip, strike and any remanent magnetization; however, the dip and the susceptibility estimates do assume that there is no remanent magnetization. Image processing of the source‐parameter grids enhances detail and provides maps that facilitate interpretation by nonspecialists.

This setting was designed to simulate a banded-iron exploration environment. The depth extent and dip of the recovered anomalies in the parametric inversions matched closely with the true synthetic model, and the results were considered an improvement over conventional voxel-based inversions. Subsequently, the approach was tested on field data sets collected over the West Plains banded-iron gold exploration area in Nunavut, Canada. This provided new interpretations regarding the spatial location, depth and dip of the linear conductors in the area.

  abstract = { We present a method for inverting magnetic data with interfering anomalies produced by multiple complex 2D magnetic sources having arbitrary shapes and known magnetization vectors. Our method is stable and can recover a complex 2D magnetization distribution, leading to a reliable delineation of sectionally homogeneous sources with complex shapes. Our method, although similar to interactive forward modeling, is unique in that it automatically fits the observations and only requires that the interpreter know the outlines of the sources expressed by simple geometric elements such as points and line segments. Each geometric element operates as a skeletal outline of a particular homogeneous section of the magnetic source to be reconstructed. Also, the interpreter can define the geometric elements interactively without worrying about data fitting because data are fit automatically. The examples with synthetic data illustrate the good performance of the method in mapping the complex geometry of magnetic sources. The solution sensitivity to uncertainties in the a priori information shows that to produce good results, the uncertainty on the magnetization intensity of each homogeneous extent of the source should be smaller than 40\%. A wrong magnetization vector direction can be detected easily because it often leads to poor data fitting and to estimated sources with abrupt borders. The method is also applied to two sets of real data from the Northwest Ore Body at Iron Mountain Mine, Missouri, and the Hatton-Rockall Basin in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. The estimated magnetization distribution in all tests demonstrates a good correlation of estimated magnetic sources with corresponding known geologic features. },

  abstract = {This work presents the application of an integrated geophysical survey of magnetometry and frequency-domain electromagetic data (FDEM) to image a geological unit located in the Kalat-e-Reshm prospect area in Iran which has good potential for ore mineralization. The aim of this study is to concentrate on a 3D arc-shaped andesite unit, where it has been concealed by a sedimentary cover. This unit consists of two segments; the top one is a porphyritic andesite having potential for ore mineralization, especially copper, whereas the lower segment corresponds to an unaltered andesite rock. Airborne electromagnetic data were used to delineate the top segment as a resistive unit embedded in a sediment column of alluvial fan, while the lower andesite unit was detected by magnetic field data. In our research, the FDEM data were first inverted by a laterally-constrained 1D program to provide three pieces of information that facilitate full 3D inversion of EM data: (1) noise levels associated with the FDEM observations, (2) an estimate of the general conductivity structure in the prospect area, and (3) the location of the sought target. Then EM data inversion was extended to 3D using a parallelized OcTree-based code to better determine the boundaries of the porphyry unit, where a transition exists from surface sediment to the upper segment. Moreover, a mixed-norm inversion approach was taken into account for magnetic data to construct a compact and sharp susceptible andesite unit at depth, beneath the top resistive and non-susceptible segment. The blind geological unit was eventually interpreted based on a combined model of conductivity and magnetic susceptibility acquired from individually inverting these geophysical surveys, which were collected simultaneously.},

In this study, potential field data are inverted in 3D to image the variations of magnetic susceptibility and density contrast along the collision zone, resulting in better tectonic understanding of the studied region. Geophysical data measured by airborne magnetic and ground-based gravity systems are used to construct an integrated model that facilitates the interpretations of various tectonic zones across a 450-km line. This line intersects the main structural units from the SW portion of the Zagros belt. The constructed model reveals a contrast that indicates the transition between the two continental plates coinciding with the western boundaries of the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (SSZ) at the Main Zagros Thrust (MZT) fault. The subduction of the Arabian continental crust below the Iranian one is evident because of its lower susceptibility property and alternating sequence of high and low density regions. Higher susceptibility, magnetic remanence and density are the mainstays of the Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Assemblage (UDMA) zone at the NE of the studied route, whereas lower values of these properties correspond to (1) the thin massive Tertiary-Neogene and Quaternary sediments of the central domain (CD) zone, and (2) the thick sedimentary and salt intrusion cover over the Zagros Fold-and-Thrust belt (ZFTB). Higher density of regions in the Arabian crust below the ZFTB implies that fault activities have caused significant vertical displacement of the basement. Finally, a simplified geological model is presented based upon the inversions of the geophysical data, in which the main geological units are divided along the studied route.},

  abstract = {Active, large volume, silicic magma systems are potentially the most hazardous form of volcanism on Earth. Knowledge of the location, size, and physical properties of silicic magma reservoirs, is therefore important for providing context in which to accurately interpret monitoring data and make informed hazard assessments. Accordingly, we present the first geophysical image of the Laguna del Maule volcanic field magmatic system, using a novel 3D inversion of gravity data constrained by thermodynamic modelling. The joint analysis of gravity and thermodynamic data allows for a rich interpretation of the magma system, and highlights the importance of considering the full thermodynamic effects on melt density, when interpreting gravity models of active magmatic systems. We image a 30 km3, low density, volatile rich magma reservoir, at around 2 km depth, containing at least 85% melt, hosted within a broader 115 km3 body interpreted as wholly or partially crystallised (>70% crystal) cumulate mush. Our model suggests a magmatic system with shallow, crystal poor magma, overlying deeper, crystal rich magma. Even though a large density contrast (−600 kg/m3) with the surrounding crust exists, the lithostatic load is 50% greater than the magma buoyancy force, suggesting buoyancy alone is insufficient to trigger an eruption. The reservoir is adjacent to the inferred extension of the Troncoso fault and overlies the location of an intruding sill, driving present day deformation. The reservoir is in close proximity to the 2.0 km3 Nieblas (rln) eruption at 2–3 ka, which we calculate tapped approximately 7% of the magma reservoir. However, we suggest that the present day magma system is not large enough to have fed all post-glacial eruptions, and that the location, or size of the system may have migrated or varied over time, with each eruption tapping only a small aliquot of the available magma. The presence of a shallow reservoir of volatile rich, near liquidus magma, in close proximity to regional scale faulting, has important implications for volcano monitoring and hazard mitigation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Knowledge of the declination and inclination of the total and induced magnetization vectors is normally required for the interpretation and analysis of magnetic anomalies. A new method of estimating the direction of the total magnetization vector of magnetized rocks from magnetic anomalies is proposed. The unknown declination and inclination (D*T and I*T) can be found by applying a reduction-to-the-pole operator to the measured anomalies for different couples of total magnetization direction parameters (DT and IT) and by observing the variation of the anomaly minimum as a function of both DT and I*T.and D*T are estimated using the maximum of this function. Comparing our method to previous methods, one advantage is that our estimates are not zero-level dependent; furthermore, the method allows inclinations to be well estimated, with the same accuracy as declinations; finally declinations are not underestimated. Our method is applied to a real case and meaningful results are obtained; it is shown that the feasibility of the method is improved by removing the low-frequency components.},

  abstract = {{Measurements of the magnetic field are one of the most used methods in geophysical exploration. In order to reduce the degree of ambiguity of this technique during inversion and modelling, data acquired by newly available gradiometer systems based on Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) are used. These systems provide measurements of the full magnetic gradient tensor of the Earth’s magnetic field, which offers a higher directional sensitivity than conventional total field magnetometers. A magnetization vector inversion (MVI) approach has been applied on data sets acquired over a dolerite intrusion in central Germany in order to model the full magnetization vector including remanent and induced components. Two different models have been created: one using only the magnetic total field anomaly (TFA) and the other based on five components of the magnetic gradient tensor. The two models show in principal the same structure, but the model based on the gradient tensor shows better defined structures. Also, magnetization amplitudes are closer to those measured on rock samples in this area. A comparison of the total magnetization vector of the rock samples and the models shows a better agreement in the vector direction of the gradient model compared to the total field model. A separation of induced and remanent contributions to the total magnetization has been performed and again shows better results when the gradient-based model is used. The effectiveness of the separation procedure will be discussed herein. The usage of gradiometer systems in an airborne geomagnetic exploration provides additional directional information, which is very helpful for MVIs. Compared to our model based on conventional TFA data, the gradient-based model features a much better agreement of the shape and magnetization of subsurface structures with those obtained from geologic−1al studies. The same, FTMG derived estimates of magnetization are more consistent with the results of measurements on rock samples.}},

  abstract  = { In this paper, we discuss the influence of the self‐demagnetization effect on magnetic data and present an alternative means of quantitatively interpreting such data in highly magnetic environments. In particular, we present two important results based on simulation which one might consider in their interpretation of magnetic data when self‐demagnetization is present. First, current methods for estimating total magnetization, which are typically applied to the problem of remanent magnetization, do not reliably recover this parameter when the anomalous source bodies have high magnetic susceptibilities. And second, a single value estimation of total magnetization does not provide adequate information to properly resolve subsurface geology through inversion. Numerical experiments demonstrate that directly inverting amplitude data, calculated from magnetic data yet weakly‐dependent on magnetization direction, produces superior results when interpreting data generated in terrain with high magnetic susceptibilities. },

  abstract  = {{Syn-tectonic remagnetizations related to burial processes that occurred during their extensional stage are frequently recognized in inverted sedimentary basins. The incremental fold test is the main analytical tool used to detect these syn-tectonic remagnetizations. However this test gives spurious results when asymmetrical folding occurs (i.e. both limbs were not tilted simultaneously at the same rate). Asymmetrical folding is very common in sedimentary basins, especially at their margins, during the basinal stage and subsequent tectonic inversion. To correctly analyse syn-tectonic remagnetizations in these scenarios, we propose a method to restore palaeomagnetic vectors, which allows determining the tilting of beds at the remagnetization stage and therefore gives some hints on the geometry of sedimentary basins and/or folds at the overprint acquisition time. In this paper we consider the analysis of syn-tectonic remagnetization directions for basin reconstruction in two end-member basin models (i.e. syncline vs roll-over geometry). Finally, we compare the results obtained with several northern Iberian examples (Cameros basin in the Iberian Chain, Cabuérniga and Polientes Basin in the Pyrenées), formed during the Mesozoic as extensional basins and subsequently inverted during the Cenozoic compression. From these examples we propose generalizations for the application of syn-tectonic remagnetizations to constrain the geometry of sedimentary basins.}},

  abstract      = { Summary Conventional 3D magnetic inversion methods are based on the assumption that there is no remanent magnetization, and the inversion is run for magnetic susceptibility only. However, this approach ignores the situation where the direction of magnetization of the rocks is different from the direction of the induced magnetic field. This situation happens in a case of remanent magnetization, typical for geological structures such as kimberlites, dykes, iron-rich ultramafic pegmatitoids (IRUP), platinum group element (PGE) reefs, and banded iron formations (BIF). This paper presents a novel method of inversion of magnetic data for the scalar components of the magnetization vector. The method is based on a new magnetic forward modeling algorithm, which uses triangular prisms of arbitrary shape in order to achieve a more accurate approximation of the topography and complex geological structures. The inversion also includes Gramian constraints in order to obtain a robust solution of otherwise ill-posed magnetic inverse problems. The method was successfully tested on a number of synthetic models of the magnetized bodies. The results of inversion of airborne TMI data demonstrate how inversion for the magnetization vector with Gramian constraints can improve the subsurface imaging of kimberlites. },
